    <div class="About_Rarc">
      Rarc Was born in the year 1964 in Denver, Colorado. Growing up, Rarc was inspired from his dad Stan Brakhage, who was a respected <br><br>film maker. Rarc tried other forms of art like photography, but what really stuck was woodworking. For years he has been making interior<br><br> wood work design for many companies, big and small. He couldn't do it alone though. Rarc makes all this with the help of a small team of<br><br> about five people(they come and go), and occasionally, when no one else is there, his family helps too.
